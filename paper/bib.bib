Polysomnography (PSG) system have traditionally been used for sleep monitoring, but alternative methods can help to make sleep monitoring more portable in someone’s home. This study conducted a series of experiments to investigate the use of pressure sensors placed under the bed as an alternative to PSG for monitoring heart rate and breathing during sleep. The following sets of experiments involved the addition of small rubber domes - transparent and black - that were glued to the pressure sensor. The resulting data were compared with the PSG system to determine the accuracy of the pressure sensor readings. The study found that the pressure sensor provided reliable data for extracting heart rate and respiration rate, with mean absolute errors (MAE) of 2.32 and 3.24 for respiration and heart rate, respectively. However, the addition of small rubber hemispheres did not significantly improve the accuracy of the readings, with MAEs of 2.3 bpm and 7.56 breaths per minute for respiration rate and heart rate, respectively. The findings of this study suggest that pressure sensors placed under the bed may serve as a viable alternative to traditional PSG systems for monitoring heart rate and breathing during sleep. These sensors provide a more comfortable and non-invasive method of sleep monitoring. However, the addition of small rubber domes did not significantly enhance the accuracy of the readings, indicating that it may not be a worthwhile addition to the pressure sensor system.}, journal={Procedia Computer Science}, author={Asadov, Akhmadbek and Ortega, Juan Antonio and Madrid, Natividad Martínez and Seepold, Ralf}, year={2023}, month=jan, pages={1891–1899}, collection={27th International Conference on Knowledge Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Sytems (KES 2023)} }
@article{Asadov_Seepold_Madrid_Ortega, title={Non-Invasive Cardiorespiration Monitoring Using Force Resistive Sensor}, abstractNote={Sleep analysis using a Polysomnography system is difficult and expensive. That is why we suggest a non-invasive and unobtrusive measurement. Very few people want the cables or devices attached to their bodies during sleep. The proposed approach is to implement a monitoring system, so the subject is not bothered. As a result, the idea is a non-invasive monitoring system based on detecting pressure distribution. This system should be able to measure the pressure differences that occur during a single heartbeat and during breathing through the mattress. The system consists of two blocks signal acquisition and signal processing. This whole technology should be economical to be affordable enough for every user. As a result, preprocessed data is obtained for further detailed analysis using different filters for heartbeat and respiration detection. In the initial stage of filtration, Butterworth filters are used.}, author={Asadov, Akhmadbek and Seepold, Ralf and Madrid, Natividad Martínez and Ortega, Juan Antonio}, language={en} }

However, the traditional approach to sleep analysis—polysomnography (PSG)—is intrusive and expensive. Therefore, there is great interest in the development of non-contact, non-invasive, and non-intrusive sleep monitoring systems and technologies that can reliably and accurately measure cardiorespiratory parameters with minimal impact on the patient. This has led to the development of other relevant approaches, which are characterised, for example, by the fact that they allow greater freedom of movement and do not require direct contact with the body, i.e., they are non-contact. This systematic review discusses the relevant methods and technologies for non-contact monitoring of cardiorespiratory activity during sleep. Taking into account the current state of the art in non-intrusive technologies, we can identify the methods of non-intrusive monitoring of cardiac and respiratory activity, the technologies and types of sensors used, and the possible physiological parameters available for analysis. To do this, we conducted a literature review and summarised current research on the use of non-contact technologies for non-intrusive monitoring of cardiac and respiratory activity. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the selection of publications were established prior to the start of the search. Publications were assessed using one main question and several specific questions. We obtained 3774 unique articles from four literature databases (Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and Scopus) and checked them for relevance, resulting in 54 articles that were analysed in a structured way using terminology. The result was 15 different types of sensors and devices (e.g., radar, temperature sensors, motion sensors, cameras) that can be installed in hospital wards and departments or in the environment. The ability to detect heart rate, respiratory rate, and sleep disorders such as apnoea was among the characteristics examined to investigate the overall effectiveness of the systems and technologies considered for cardiorespiratory monitoring. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of the considered systems and technologies were identified by answering the identified research questions. The results obtained allow us to determine the current trends and the vector of development of medical technologies in sleep medicine for future researchers and research.}, number={1111}, journal={Sensors}, publisher={Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute}, author={Boiko, Andrei and Martínez Madrid, Natividad and Seepold, Ralf}, year={2023}, month=jan, pages={5038}, language={en} }

Among others, the ones based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors reveal remarkable promise for monitoring respiratory rate (RR) and heart rate (HR). The present study investigates the performance of a mattress based on a 13-FBG array for HR continuous estimation. First, a metrological characterization was performed to assess system characteristics under frequencies simulating typical HR values [i.e., 60, 90, and 120 beats per minute (bpm)]. Then, the proposed device was tested on eight healthy volunteers (both males and females) in the presence of different breathing stages (i.e., quiet breathing and tachypnea) while mimicking common sleeping postures (i.e., supine, left side, and prone). The assessment of HR measurements under different breathing regimes and postures has rarely been addressed in FBG-based technologies. The achieved results suggest that the proposed mattress has promising capability in reliably estimating HR values. These results together with the ones obtained in terms of RR monitoring in a recent study reveal the high potential for monitoring cardiorespiratory activity.}, number={13}, journal={IEEE Sensors Journal}, author={De Tommasi, Francesca and Massaroni, Carlo and Caponero, Michele Arturo and Carassiti, Massimiliano and Schena, Emiliano and Lo Presti, Daniela}, year={2023}, month=jul, pages={14114–14122} }

Furthermore, the selection of appropriate technology for the measurement of respiration is of great importance. Therefore, after performing initial literature research, we have analysed in detail three different methods and made a selection of a proper one according to determined requirements.

Due to the time-consuming, highly obtrusive, and expensive nature of using the standard approaches such as polysomnography, it is of great interest to develop a noninvasive and unobtrusive in-home sleep monitoring system that can reliably and accurately measure cardiorespiratory parameters while causing minimal discomfort to the user’s sleep. We developed a low-cost Out of Center Sleep Testing (OCST) system with low complexity to measure cardiorespiratory parameters. We tested and validated two force-sensitive resistor strip sensors under the bed mattress covering the thoracic and abdominal regions. Twenty subjects were recruited, including 12 males and 8 females. The ballistocardiogram signal was processed using the 4th smooth level of the discrete wavelet transform and the 2nd order of the Butterworth bandpass filter to measure the heart rate and respiration rate, respectively. We reached a total error (concerning the reference sensors) of 3.24 beats per minute and 2.32 rates for heart rate and respiration rate, respectively. For males and females, heart rate errors were 3.47 and 2.68, and respiration rate errors were 2.32 and 2.33, respectively. We developed and verified the reliability and applicability of the system. It showed a minor dependency on sleeping positions, one of the major cumbersome sleep measurements. We identified the sensor under the thoracic region as the optimal configuration for cardiorespiratory measurement. Although testing the system with healthy subjects and regular patterns of cardiorespiratory parameters showed promising results, further investigation is required with the bandwidth frequency and validation of the system with larger groups of subjects, including patients.}, number={88}, journal={Sensors}, publisher={Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute}, author={Haghi, Mostafa and Asadov, Akhmadbek and Boiko, Andrei and Ortega, Juan Antonio and Martínez Madrid, Natividad and Seepold, Ralf}, year={2023}, month=jan, pages={3973}, language={en} }

This work aims to provide a guide to current bed-based sensor technologies with diverse applications in various settings. We conducted a retrospective literature review, summarizing the state-of-the-art research over the past decade on non-contact bed-based sensor technology in sleep monitoring. We developed a three-category terminology: unobtrusive sensor technology, application, and subject. A total of 263 unique articles were acquired from three databases and screened for relevance, resulting in 21 papers selected for in-depth analysis. The findings revealed eight types of sensors: six mechanical sensors (pressure, accelerometer, piezoelectric, load cell, electromechanical film (EMFI), and hydraulic) and two FOSs (fiber Bragg grating and microbend FOS) that are integrated with or positioned under the bed at three levels of unobtrusiveness. We identified 15 parameters, with heart rate (HR) (14) and respiratory rate (RR) (13) being the most frequently measured. These parameters are generally categorized into three applications: disease-related diagnosis (18), general sleep analysis (9), and general well-being (11). The results indicated that sleep apnea (5) and insomnia (2) were the most frequently detected sleep disorders. Additionally, 59.1% (13) of the systems were tested in a lab environment, with only one undergoing clinical trials.

Traditional diagnostic methods, like polysomnography (PSG), are unobtrusive, leading to noninvasive monitoring. This study aims to develop and validate a novel sleep monitoring system using noninvasive sensor technology to estimate cardiorespiratory parameters and detect sleep apnea. We designed a seamless monitoring system integrating noncontact force-sensitive resistor sensors to collect ballistocardiogram signals associated with cardiorespiratory activity. We enhanced the sensor’s sensitivity and reduced the noise by designing a new concept of edge-measuring sensor using a hemisphere dome and mechanical hanger to distribute the force and mechanically amplify the micromovement caused by cardiac and respiration activities. In total, we deployed three edge-measuring sensors, two deployed under the thoracic and one under the abdominal regions. The system is supported with onboard signal preprocessing in multiple physical layers deployed under the mattress. We collected the data in four sleeping positions from 16 subjects and analyzed them using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to avoid frequency mixing. We also developed an adaptive thresholding method to identify sleep apnea. The error was reduced to 3.98 and 1.43 beats/min (BPM) in heart rate (HR) and respiration estimation, respectively. The apnea was detected with an accuracy of 87%. We optimized the system such that only one edge-measuring sensor can measure the cardiorespiratory parameters. Such a reduction in the complexity and simplification of the instruction of use shows excellent potential for in-home and continuous monitoring.}, number={8}, journal={IEEE Sensors Journal}, author={Haghi, Mostafa and Madrid, Natividad Martínez and Seepold, Ralf}, year={2024}, month=apr, pages={13364–13377} }

Getting enough quality sleep is necessary to a person’s mental health, physiological well-being, quality of life, and safety. Sleep-disordered breathing, specifically obstructive sleep apnea can result in serious health issues, including hypertension and stroke. The current approaches for diagnosing sleep disorders are burdensome, intrusive, and can affect the patient’s sleep quality. As a result, there is a crucial need for less cumbersome systems to diagnose sleep-related problems. In this paper, we evaluated the capacity of the microbend fiber optic sensor to monitor heart rate and respiration in a nonintrusive manner. In addition, we tested the capacity of the sensor in discriminating between shallow breathing and no breathing. The proposed sensor was compared with the three-channel portable monitoring device (ApneaLink) in a clinical setting during a drug-induced sleep endoscopy. Across all ten patients recruited for our study, the system achieved satisfactory results in the mean heart rate and the mean respiratory rate with an error of 0.55 ± 0.59 beats/minute and 0.38 ± 0.32 breaths/minute, respectively. Besides, the Pearson correlation coefficient between the proposed sensor and the reference device was 0.96 and 0.78 for heart rate and respiration, respectively. On the contrary, the proposed sensor provided a very low sensitivity (24.24 ± 12.81%) and a relatively high specificity (85.88 ± 6.01%) for sleep apnea detection.

To overcome this drawback, this work describes an algorithm for beat-to-beat heart rate detection from ballistocardiogram (BCG) in sitting, standing, and supine positions with different sensors both in the longitudinal and transverse directions. The algorithm is based on the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) with splines and its envelope to estimate the J-wave peak (Jp) position in the BCG. The BCG and CWT and its envelope are then analyzed for BCG morphology type and a backward or forward search is performed to reduce false positives to find Jp. The algorithm was evaluated in recordings of three BCG databases: longitudinal BCG of chair (7 seated recordings), transverse BCG of bed (17 supine recordings) and longitudinal BCG of weighing scale (14 standing recordings), obtaining the following values of sensitivity and positive predictivity in the BCG databases: chair (99.87% and 98.48%), bed (99.64% and 97.60%) and weighing scale (99% and 88%) over 9266 beats.

New electromechanical film (EMFi) sensors are now able to detect minimal oscillations in its surface, allowing to detect the mechanical action of the heart as it beats. This has allowed to develop unobtrusive systems for heart rate monitoring to be used as Point-of-Care devices, and to deploy them in waiting rooms, assisted living facilities or at home. In this work, an EMFi sensor is used to measure BCG via the pressure changes on the seat produced by the beating heart. In a lab environment, 34 healthy volunteers are measured under two conditions: at rest and after exercise, simultaneously with ECG. Also, in a clinical environment, 24 volunteers are also measured while waiting. The algorithm looks for the variability of the length transform at different scales or windows to determine a search window to detect beats from the BCG. A second correlation filter helps eliminate false peaks detected due to noise in the signal. Results show that in resting conditions, the mean error between the BCG HR and the reference ECG is only 0.4 beats per minute, with a standard deviation of 1.88. The noise rejection accuracy is 93%.

As an example, when people age one possible condition that they may experience is sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). SDB, better known as the obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome, and associated cardiovascular complications are among the most common clinical disorders. The gold-standard approach to accurately diagnose OSA, is polysomnography (PSG), a test that should be performed in a specialist sleep clinic and requires a complete overnight stay at the clinic. The PSG system can provide accurate and real-time data; however, it introduces several challenges such as complexity, invasiveness, excessive cost, and absence of privacy. Technological advancements in hardware and software enable noninvasive and unobtrusive sensing of vital signs. An alternative approach which may help diagnose OSA and other cardiovascular diseases is the ballistocardiography. The ballistocardiogram (BCG) signal captures the ballistic forces of the heart caused by the sudden ejection of blood into the great vessels with each heartbeat, breathing, and body movement. In recent years, BCG sensors such as polyvinylidene fluoride film-based sensors, electromechanical films, strain Gauges, hydraulic sensors, microbend fiber-optic sensors as well as fiber Bragg grating sensors have been integrated within ambient locations such as mattresses, pillows, chairs, beds, or even weighing scales, to capture BCG signals, and thereby measure vital signs. Analysis of the BCG signal is a challenging process, despite being a more convenient and comfortable method of vital signs monitoring. In practice, BCG sensors are placed under bed mattresses for sleep tracking, and hence several factors, e.g., mattress thickness, body movements, motion artifacts, bed-partners, etc. can deteriorate the signal. In this paper, we introduce the sensors that are being used for obtaining BCG signals. We also present an in-depth review of the signal processing methods as applied to the various sensors, to analyze the BCG signal and extract physiological parameters such heart rate and breathing rate, as well as determining sleep stages. Besides, we recommend which methods are more suitable for processing BCG signals due to their nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics.}, number={1}, journal={Health Information Science and Systems}, author={Sadek, Ibrahim and Biswas, Jit and Abdulrazak, Bessam}, year={2019}, month=may, pages={10}, language={en} }

HRV and PRV therefore, are not exactly interchangeable terms. However, the paper proposes that PRV and HRV can be correlated. Aim: To compare the correlation between two different instruments – (I) gold-standard Polar H10 HRV sensor that works on the principle of CAM and Kubios software for HRV estimation, together called ‘PK’ and (II) Lyfas smartphone application called ‘L’, which estimates PRV that reflects the state of CvAM. Methods: Parameters, such as (i) HR, (ii) RMSSD, (iii) pNN50, (iv) SDNN, and (v) LF/HF are captured from a total of 567 healthy Indian adults (312 males and 255 females) using PK and L simultaneously. End HR data (120 sec) are then compared instrument and gender-wise statistically by computing the i) RMSE, ii) Regressions (L on PK), iii) a Two-sample t-test, and (iv) classification accuracy of L when compared to PK. Finally, the Sensitivity/recall (R), Specificity (S), Precision (P), Accuracy (A), F score (F), and Youden’s index (Y) are computed for L. Results: L shows encouraging averages for males and females respectively ‘R’ (84%, 70%), ‘S’ (95%, 87%), ‘A’ (82%, 79%), ‘P’ (87%, 69%),’F’ (1.4836, 1.3706) and ‘Y’ (79%, 81%) for HR, SDNN, RMSSD, and pNN50 respectively. Conclusions: Although ‘L’ has 1/33th times less resolution compared to PK, its technical efficacy, speed, user-friendliness, low-cost-benefit, high ‘Y’ values, and ubiquitousness pose a great advantage in its deployment in the clinical setup as a biomarker tool over PK.}, number={1}, journal={Journal of Biomedical Engineering and Technology}, author={Chattopadhyay, Subhagata and Das, Rupam}, year={2021}, month=dec, pages={1–9}, language={en} }

Both heart rate (HR) and variability (HRV), as represented by variation in RR interval timing, as well as analysis of ECG waveform variability, have shown potential in its measurement. Validation of RF accuracy using newer consumer hardware and software applications have been sparse. The intent of this report is to assess the precision of the RF derived using Kubios HRV Premium software version 3.5 with the Movesense Medical sensor single-channel ECG (MS ECG) and the Polar H10 (H10) HR monitor. Gas exchange data (GE), RR intervals (H10), and continuous ECG (MS ECG) were recorded from 21 participants performing an incremental cycling ramp to failure. Results showed high correlations between the reference GE and both the H10 (r = 0.85, SEE = 4.2) and MS ECG (r = 0.95, SEE = 2.6). Although median values were statistically different via Wilcoxon testing, adjusted median differences were clinically small for the H10 (RF about 1 breaths/min) and trivial for the MS ECG (RF about 0.1 breaths/min). ECG based measurement with the MS ECG showed reduced bias, limits of agreement (maximal bias, −2.0 breaths/min, maximal LoA, 6.1 to −10.0 breaths/min) compared to the H10 (maximal bias, −3.9 breaths/min, maximal LoA, 8.2 to −16.0 breaths/min). In conclusion, RF derived from the combination of the MS ECG sensor with Kubios HRV Premium software, tracked closely to the reference device through an exercise ramp, illustrates the potential for this system to be of practical usage during endurance exercise.}, number={1919}, journal={Sensors}, publisher={Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute}, author={Rogers, Bruce and Schaffarczyk, Marcelle and Gronwald, Thomas}, year={2022}, month=jan, pages={7156}, language={en} }

The rising use of freely accessible applications for its recording requires validation processes to ensure accurate data. It is the aim of this study to compare the HRV data obtained by the Polar H10 sensor chest strap device and an electrocardiogram (ECG) with the focus on RR intervals and short-term scaling exponent alpha 1 of Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA a1) as non-linear metric of HRV analysis. A group of 25 participants performed an exhaustive cycling ramp with measurements of HRV with both recording systems. Average time between heartbeats (RR), heart rate (HR) and DFA a1 were recorded before (PRE), during, and after (POST) the exercise test. High correlations were found for the resting conditions (PRE: r = 0.95, rc = 0.95, ICC3,1 = 0.95, POST: r = 0.86, rc = 0.84, ICC3,1 = 0.85) and for the incremental exercise (r > 0.93, rc > 0.93, ICC3,1 > 0.93). While PRE and POST comparisons revealed no differences, significant bias could be found during the exercise test for all variables (p < 0.001). For RR and HR, bias and limits of agreement (LoA) in the Bland–Altman analysis were minimal (RR: bias of 0.7 to 0.4 ms with LoA of 4.3 to −2.8 ms during low intensity and 1.3 to −0.5 ms during high intensity, HR: bias of −0.1 to −0.2 ms with LoA of 0.3 to −0.5 ms during low intensity and 0.4 to −0.7 ms during high intensity). DFA a1 showed wider bias and LoAs (bias of 0.9 to 8.6% with LoA of 11.6 to −9.9% during low intensity and 58.1 to −40.9% during high intensity). Linear HRV measurements derived from the Polar H10 chest strap device show strong agreement and small bias compared with ECG recordings and can be recommended for practitioners. However, with respect to DFA a1, values in the uncorrelated range and during higher exercise intensities tend to elicit higher bias and wider LoA.}, number={1717}, journal={Sensors}, publisher={Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute}, author={Schaffarczyk, Marcelle and Rogers, Bruce and Reer, Rüdiger and Gronwald, Thomas}, year={2022}, month=jan, pages={6536}, language={en} }

Main funding source(s): Antwerp University HospitalIn the last decade, heart rate (HR) monitors have become popular consumer tools for physical activity registration and training guidance. HR tracking could assist in following up cardiac patients. However, a profound validation of such monitors in cardiac populations, with HR monitors worn for a long period of time and compared to the gold standard Holter monitoring, is lacking.This pilot study assessed the accuracy of 2 HR monitors (Polar H10 chest strap and Fitbit Inspire 2 tracker) compared to Holter in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), heart failure (HF) and following cardiac rehabilitation (CR).A total of 15 patients (5 AF, 5 HF and 5 CR) with a scheduled 24-hour Holter monitor were asked to wear both Polar H10 and Fitbit Inspire 2 simultaneously with their Holter. All three devices were perfectly aligned in time. To be comparable with Polar and Fitbit data, Holter data was represented as a moving average of 3 and 5 data points, respectively. Raw Polar and Fitbit data were processed by a first version of an in-house designed artefact removal algorithm that labelled extreme values as artefacts based on the expected HR values per patient and the steepness of HR increases/decreases, resulting in cleaned data. Accuracy was assessed in raw and cleaned data using Pearson correlation coefficients (r), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percent error (MAPE, criterion: ≤10%) and Bland-Altman analysis (95% Limits of Agreement, LOA).Raw Polar H10 HR data showed a strong correlation (r=0.932), a MAE of 3.43 beats per minute (bpm) and a MAPE of 4.86%. The cleaned Polar H10 data showed a small further improvement. Raw Fitbit Inspire 2 HR data showed a weak correlation (r=0.678), a MAE of 8.68 bpm and a MAPE of 14.56%. The agreement in the cleaned Fitbit Inspire 2 data improved to a moderate correlation (r=0.758), a MAE of 7.12 bpm and a MAPE of 12.24%. The findings varied per patient group, with highest accuracies in the CR group and lowest in the AF group (based on MAE/MAPE and Polar correlation) and in the HF group (based on Fitbit correlation). Bland-Altman analysis indicated that Polar H10 over- and underestimated HR equally in all groups, but to a lesser extent in the cleaned data. In contrast, Fitbit Inspire 2 overestimated HR more frequently than underestimating it, both overall and for the groups separately, but again to a lesser extent in the cleaned data (Table 1 and Figure 1).Compared to gold standard Holter monitoring, Polar H10 is very accurate at assessing HR over a 24h time window, while the accuracy of Fitbit Inspire 2 is weaker. The results differ between several cardiac patient groups. We were able to improve accuracy by detecting and correcting artefacts. We are further exploring technical possibilities, striving for an improved and automatic way to continuously monitor HR in cardiac patients, which may help to monitor and guide their physical activities.Table 1Figure 1}, number={Supplement_1}, journal={EP Europace}, author={Vermunicht, P and Makayed, K and Meysman, P and Laukens, K and Knaepen, L and Vervoort, Y and De Bliek, E and Hens, W and Van Craenenbroeck, E and Desteghe, L and Heidbuchel, H}, year={2023}, month=jun, pages={euad122.550} }

Sleep Talking

It does not represent a pathological condition and consists in the unaware production of vocalisations during sleep. Although in the last few decades we have experienced a remarkable increase in knowledge about cognitive processes and behavioural manifestations during sleep, the literature regarding sleep talking remains dated and fragmentary. We first provide an overview of historical and recent findings regarding sleep talking, and we then discuss the phenomenon in the context of mental activity during sleep. It is shown that verbal utterances, reflecting the ongoing dream content, may represent the unique possibility to access the dreamlike mental experience directly. Furthermore, we discuss such phenomena within a cognitive theoretical framework, considering both the atypical activation of psycholinguistic circuits during sleep and the implications of verbal ‘replay’ of recent learning in memory consolidation. Despite current knowledge on such a common experience being far from complete, an in-depth analysis of sleep talking episodes could offer interesting opportunities to address fundamental questions on dreaming or information processing during sleep. Further systematic polysomnographic and neuroimaging investigations are expected to shed new light on the manifestation of the phenomenon and related aspects.}, journal={Sleep Medicine Reviews}, author={Alfonsi, Valentina and D’Atri, Aurora and Scarpelli, Serena and Mangiaruga, Anastasia and De Gennaro, Luigi}, year={2019}, month=apr, pages={12–22} }

We analyzed sleep-associated speech in adults, mostly (92%) during parasomnias.The utterances recorded during night-time video-polysomnography were analyzed for number of words, propositions and speech episodes, frequency, gaps and pauses (denoting turn-taking in the conversation), lemmatization, verbosity, negative/imperative/interrogative tone, first/second person, politeness, and abuse.Two hundred thirty-two subjects (aged 49.5 ± 20 years old; 41% women; 129 with rapid eye movement [REM] sleep behavior disorder and 87 with sleepwalking/sleep terrors, 15 healthy subjects, and 1 patient with sleep apnea speaking in non-REM sleep) uttered 883 speech episodes, containing 59% nonverbal utterance (mumbles, shouts, whispers, and laughs) and 3349 understandable words. The most frequent word was “No”: negations represented 21.4% of clauses (more in non-REM sleep). Interrogations were found in 26% of speech episodes (more in non-REM sleep), and subordinate clauses were found in 12.9% of speech episodes. As many as 9.7% of clauses contained profanities (more in non-REM sleep). Verbal abuse lasted longer in REM sleep and was mostly directed toward insulting or condemning someone, whereas swearing predominated in non-REM sleep. Men sleep-talked more than women and used a higher proportion of profanities. Apparent turn-taking in the conversation respected the usual language gaps.Sleep talking parallels awake talking for syntax, semantics, and turn-taking in conversation, suggesting that the sleeping brain can function at a high level. Language during sleep is mostly a familiar, tensed conversation with inaudible others, suggestive of conflicts.}, number={11}, journal={Sleep}, author={Arnulf, Isabelle and Uguccioni, Ginevra and Gay, Frederick and Baldayrou, Etienne and Golmard, Jean-Louis and Gayraud, Frederique and Devevey, Alain}, year={2017}, month=nov, pages={zsx159} }
